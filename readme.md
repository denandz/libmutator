# Libmutator

Libmutator is a C library intended to generate random test cases by mutating legitimate test cases. This project is heavily influenced by [honggfuzz](https://github.com/google/honggfuzz), [radamsa](https://gitlab.com/akihe/radamsa) and [AFL](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/). 

This project started because I needed a way to go and generate random testcases in a C project and didn't want to include a complete fuzzing suite to do so.

## WIP

Libmutator is still a work-in-progress, future updates, functionality and docs will follow.

## Basic usage

See the test directory for examples of how to use libmutator.
